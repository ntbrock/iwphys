Taylor
L> Graph Prototypes in 2 differrnt tools. Wireframed the new UI.
N> Prototype in a 3rd technology - D3, Labeling axes the right way in prototype.

Matt
L> Try to get the Axes working on prototype, hitting Null Pointer Exceptions.
N> Next week: demo of axes.

Jon
L> Reviewed 20 more animations that we want to use again this year. Will add the list to teh trello - Hands floating in space, animations that need the graphing feature. Found one that's not converted to IWP5, still linked to iwp2.ncssm.edu. 
N> Post the List to Trello.  Excited to see the demos!  How can I test?

= Trello Review - Including the new list of 10 bugs.
	
	- Plotly - Pro's nice label, good api, colorization, axes.  Con - Slow to animate by adding on data points.

	- Easel - Pro's very fast, implementation matches IWP4 blank canvas.  Con - Would need to rebuild all the axes rendering, etc ourselves.

	- D3 - Data Driven Documents -- In between solution. It's the same tech that we're using for animations that Ryan S. did.
		* Taylor> Demo of D3.
		Pro - easlier to convert / port from the animation
		Con - May need code refactoring -- Watch out for global variables during the refactor!

= Demonstration of graphing progress

= Show the task breakdown of January / February development plan

= Review an animation that needs graphing that currently doesnâ€™t work

= Find a way Dr. Bennett can contirbue in next 2 weeks. - Wireframes and UI Research
