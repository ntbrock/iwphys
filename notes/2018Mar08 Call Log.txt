Taylor
L> Focused on the circular reference and eulers. Bolted the iwp4 calculator into a web service. Designed how I want to put that into iwp5.
N> Write comparison tests to compare v4 -vs- v5. Create a new javascript to be able to switch between both of them.   Success is reviewing step by step (tick by tick) that all the variables are equals.
