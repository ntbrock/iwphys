Jon
L> Finished going thru all animations in use last year, found the remaining bugs that need to fixed, have a list to upload.  Tested the 4 demos with the new graphing features, look good!
N> Need tasks!

Taylor
L> Graphing - now goes backwards. Call w/ Ryan Steed this morning talking about summer plans!
N> Graphing - Should honor the scale set by the animation file.

Matt
L> Finals + Finishing College stuff. 
N> Pair at end of meeting today to colorize the button toggles.


* Taylor> Back button should reverse the object trails on the aniumation as well.

* Matt+Taylor> Illuminate the graph series toggle buttons.

+> Use a radio selector to only allow a certain measure to be plotted on the graph at one time.
	Quick to toggle between them.

+> Possibly using a huge or an opacity to help differentiate the measure.

+> Show the units in the button labels themselves, : xPos (m),  xVel (m/s)  xAccel (m/s^2)

+> Relocate the origin of the graph because negative times are not used in our current animations.

+> Add a label on the time axis with units of seconds.

+> Inititalize solid with initial velocity, so that we don't that sharp vertical line at the beginning of the graph.

16:59 New things on the testing list:

1. 1/2 of things were more animations that needed graphing features to work 5-6 of those.

2. Couple more with Floating hands that are supposed to be pushing objects around - don't move like they're supposed to.

3. A animation where nothing happened: 

4. A couple where you needed to pudate an input (initial velocity, but when you change number, didn't update animation)
