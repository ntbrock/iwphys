2018Feb01 NCSSM IWP5

- Accept grid + axis + multi-series additions to iwp5-graph.js,

- Connect the Solids from the animation memory into the graph 

- Handle the ‘reverse time’ removal of items off of the graph + animation. 



 I’ll likely have time on Friday to pull your code and do my tasks.

Taylor
L24> Hooked in graph intiailization, applied styling to the grid + axes.  
	In process: solids's from memory, dynamically update the paths in memory.

	Goal: Get it working the Velocity01b, 
	then it shoudl work one of the other animations that has graphing.
