L> Converting SVG to PNG, got it to download a sreenshot of canvas to local. Need to render w/o opening the page.  Found a library save-svg-as-png. 
N> Next step, downlading the image outside of the actual animation.

Research these technologies:

https://www.npmjs.com/package/convert-svg-to-png

https://www.seleniumhq.org/

Prefer to have an automated solution, but fall back is to manually convert them.

L> Started off looking at spring motion one. Talk thru today. Looking at side by side comparison, numbers are signficiantly different. Move onto projectile motion 040302 : Gun barrel angle not showing in new version, tracking down in code toRadians, but found other cases where it worked.
N> Continue debugging.
