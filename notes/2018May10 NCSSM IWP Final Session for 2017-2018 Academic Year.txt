i> Summer Physics is happening now, feel good about the animation content in iwp5.  If there are any remaining glitches, we need to support them + fix them.



## Goals for Fall 2018


New course in the fall trimester.   That uses some parts of IWP, new animations we'll need to create or look through existing library contents.

May need to port over and test out new animations for new course.


Over the summer take some time to review libraries and figure out which animations can be reused or need to be authored. And make a list of items to fix.

Dr. Bennett - Create a list of Animations to use for the fall course, and test + fix them together as a team.


## Goals for Spring 2019 


Create an animation designer in HTML 5 / web browser.



## In Parallel

WebAssign and Textbook problems, which ones are linked?

The textbook publisher / webassign licensing is changing on June 1st.  

We may need to re-write / re-author animation content to be compliant with new licensing.

Need to assess the scope of the problem - How many animations from iwp are associated with textbook problems?


## New Animations?!

A lot of wave situations.  Reflection / Refraction.  How much wave interferrence?
Beats 
Doppler Effect
Harmonics
Showing wave additions
