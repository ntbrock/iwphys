Team!  

This afternoon, I happily git pushed the final code for the ‘reordering’ calculation fix to our IWP6 preview site.

My next visit to campus is likely Tuesday, May 21 – Thursday, May 23, week before commencement.

I propose we schedule a brief session to:
1.	Close out any final action items or demonstrations or Trello tickets.
2.	Plan the Fall physics conference material
3.	Introduce next year’s students to the project

Dr. Bennett, would you please recommend a time Tue May 21 or Wed May 22 or Thu May 23 that would be convenient for us to host our transition meeting?

I expect the meeting to be 45 minutes or less in duration and we will need a conference room large enough to host all attendees, including the new recruits.


In summary, 

Each of us should be satisfied with the progress we made this year across the various milestones in the Interactive Web Physics project.  We started as manual QA testers and we are finishing the year as rock star scala software engineers.

I feel on track for Interactive Web Physics 6 to be generally available before the physics conference at NCSSM November 15 – 16, 2019.  I plan to use this conference opportunity to recruit new users and advocate for increased awareness of our application.

Our 2018-2019 team accomplishments include:
-	Technology stack change to Play Framework scala (from php/nginx)
-	Streamlined New developer environment setup
-	Designer User Experience prototyping in Model view controller
-	Formalized IWP6 Json format + schema
-	Animation Regression testing and calculation suite using Nashorn server-side javascript
-	Calculation ordering fix to ensure V6 javascript calculations match V4 legacy java logic

Kick ass!
