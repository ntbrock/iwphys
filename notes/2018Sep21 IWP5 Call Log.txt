i> Taylor on Campus October 3 for Bowman-Brockman project recruiting



Last Week:

Albert> Set up the environment on Mac. All good.

Niall> Everything should be working!



i> Had to add the PATH_INFO and SCRIPT_FILENAME lines to fix the Path_info issue.

Agenda
- At this point, developers should be up to speed and ready to start contributing fixes to IWP5 Codebase

- Review the List of Animations to fix

- Initial Requirements and Design for : GraphBox and Designer


GraphBox

 <object class="edu.ncssm.iwp.objects.grapher.DObject_Grapher">
                        <name>Pulse_1</name>
                        <equation>5*(0.5/3.14)/((x-2*y+5)^2+0.5^2)</equation>
                        <boxX>0.0</boxX>
                        <boxY>5.0</boxY>
                        <boxW>20.0</boxW>
                        <boxH>10.0</boxH>
                        <res>200</res>
                        <stroke>2</stroke>
                        <showBounding>true</showBounding>
                        <transformCoords>true</transformCoords>
                        <color>
                                <red>0</red>
                                <green>0</green>
                                <blue>204</blue>
                        </color>
                </object>


res - What would this do?


 // Drawable
        public void iwpDraw(IWPDrawer drawer, DProblemState state)
                throws UnknownVariableException, UnknownTickException, InvalidEquationException
        {

                MathExpression evaluator = new MathExpression(equation);

                double stepsize = BoxW / Res;

                double bx=0,by=0;

                if(transformCoords) {
                        bx = BoxX;
                        by = BoxY;
                }
                for(double x=(BoxX - BoxW/2)-bx; x<BoxX+BoxW/2-bx; x+=stepsize) {
                        double y1 = evaluator.value(x,state.vars().getCurrentTime());
                        double y2 = evaluator.value(x+stepsize,state.vars().getCurrentTime());
                        drawer.drawLine(x+bx, y1+by, x+stepsize+bx, y2+by , Stroke);
                }

                if(showBounding) {
                        drawer.drawRect(BoxX-BoxW/2, BoxY+BoxH/2, BoxW, BoxH);
                }


                //Here's the Current Time!
                //state.vars().getCurrentTime();

        }



- Unit Test:  Plotting a generic equation on to a canvas.  (d3)

- Unit Test:  Change stroke widths

- Unit Test:  Change Resolutions

- Unit Test:  Replicate all the logic from a staticially defined json object:

- Design: is xtoj.php creating proper json?

- Task: Why is Albert's opendir() animations exception?







## Testing

Goal: Start sharing the iwp-packaged Animations beyond NCSSM.

For each animation:

- Does the animation load and start playing?

- Does the description make sense?

- Do the Graphing Features Work?

- Does it change the animation when you change the input?

- Do the outputs make sense?

- Do the results match IWP Version 4, frame by frame?

- Do any of these animations need the graph box?

- What browers play the animation: Chrome, Firefox, Safai, IE 11+, Bonus: Tablet + Smartphone.


* Taylor> Create 18 tickets for each of these animations.

Next friday = Extended.


IWP Package / Electrostatics  8x  - Albert

IWP Package / Magnetism 1x - Albert


IWP Package / Gravitation 2x - Niall

IWP Package / Optics, Physical 7x - Niall


* Taylor> Schedule October 5th.


4:30PM on Wed Oct 3rd  Bowman - Brockman








Goal: Condense the animations into topics that are logical, organized, and present well to new audiences modernize it for 2019.
