2019Feb15 IWP 6 Meeting

Albert
L> UX Wireframes to lay out the web designer.
N> Prototype The left hand object ordering using dragula.js. Have everything in the list be orderable.  Recommend building the prototype in the play-version6 as a unit test.

Taylor
L> Fix for object ordering: continued to explore the experimental library, starting to feel friction.  Didn't get it all the way working.
N> Object Ordering Fix:  Explore grafting the IWP4 java code in: it already does the parsing!


After - Object Ordering - It's complicated but I have a hunch it's going to fix most of our valiation issues.

- XML parsing (In progress)
- New JSON structure
- Structural changes out to the animator
- As quickly as possible, re-run validation framework to make sure this has the impact I want to it.
- No UI changes
- Designer: need ability to order objects
