Hello Team,

I played around with it a little bit and I think IWP6 looks awesome. Thank you for all your efforts. I guess the next step is to finish tracking down and fixing the sources of any frame-by-frame differences between IWP5 and IWP6 animations. What's our timeframe for that ?

* Taylor> Run a new verification reprot, count the differences between Jan 10 -> Feb 1st.
Get a velocity and a semi educated forecast.
