eforce-02.iwp<BR>Dr. Winters,<BR><BR>I have modified the Electrical Force 
applet. The "Mode" input has the following features:<BR><BR>Mode -1 gives 
strictly horizontal motion. Initial Y pos is set to zero, but initial X pos may 
be modified.<BR><BR>Mode 1 gives strictly vertical motion. Initial X pos is set 
to zero, but initial Y pos may be modified.<BR><BR>Mode 0 gives elliptical 
motion. Both initial Y pos and initial X pos may be modified. If the distance 
between the initial position and the origin is equal to the radius (such as if 
the initial position is (r,0)), then the ellipse will be a circle.<BR><BR>Mode 5 
gives figure-eight motion. Both initial Y pos and initial X pos may be modified. 
It is suggested, but not necessary, that the initial position be 
(0,0).<BR><BR>Note that under no circumstances should the initial position be 
further away from the origin than the length of the radius. For example, an 
initial position of (2*r, r+1) would not function properly.<BR><BR>I have also 
added the floating text readout of the magnitude of the net force vector, as 
well as outputs giving the current X and Y position of the test 
charge.<BR><BR>Jason Cockrell<BR><BR>

  <DIV></DIV>Dr. Winters,<BR><BR>I am sending this applet from my gmail account 
  in the unlikely event that the filters also grab sent mail as well as received 
  mail. I have modified the gas compression applet to allow for more inputs and 
  more control of the animation by the teacher. However, I do not advise 
  throwing out the older version, because that version had the distinction of 
  calculating the physics for each of the three possible combinations of 
  isobaric, isothermal, and adiabatic processes. In this new version, 
  temperature and pressure will move between given initial and final values 
  regardless of whether the values given actually make any sense. Thus, it is up 
  to the creator of the applet to ensure that the values are 
  realistic.<BR><BR>The relevant inputs are:<BR><BR>pit --- initial 
  pressure<BR>pif --- final pressure<BR>tempi --- initial temperature<BR>tempf 
  --- final temperature<BR>p_l_def -- lower bound of the pressure 
  gauge<BR>p_u_def --- upper bound of the pressure gause<BR>t_l_def --- lower 
  bound of the thermometer<BR>t_u_def --- upper bound of the 
  thermometer<BR><BR>Jason
