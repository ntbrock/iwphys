sending this applet from my gmail account in the unlikely event that the filters 
also grab sent mail as well as received mail. I have modified the gas 
compression applet to allow for more inputs and more control of the animation by 
the teacher. However, I do not advise throwing out the older version, because 
that version had the distinction of calculating the physics for each of the 
three possible combinations of isobaric, isothermal, and adiabatic processes. In 
this new version, temperature and pressure will move between given initial and 
final values regardless of whether the values given actually make any sense. 
Thus, it is up to the creator of the applet to ensure that the values are 
realistic.<BR><BR>The relevant inputs are:<BR><BR>pit --- initial 
pressure<BR>pif --- final pressure<BR>tempi --- initial temperature<BR>tempf --- 
final temperature<BR>p_l_def -- lower bound of the pressure gauge<BR>p_u_def --- 
upper bound of the pressure gause<BR>t_l_def --- lower bound of the 
thermometer<BR>t_u_def --- upper bound of the thermometer<BR><BR>Jason
