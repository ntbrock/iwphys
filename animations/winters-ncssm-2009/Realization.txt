Dr. Winters,

Almost immediately upon returning to my room, I had this important realization:

( A Modulo B ) = ( (A/B) Modulo 1 ) X B

This is important because, using the step function, the computational complexity of ( A Modulo B ) is proportional to A/B, whereas there is a way using powers of ten to achieve a computational complexity for ( A Modulo 1 ) proportional to the base-ten logarithm of A. Therefore, disregard my previous claims of a limit of 100 for the ratio A/B. It is actually relatively simple to find modulo values for very large A.
