<DIV></DIV>Dr. Winters,<BR><BR>I've fixed the appearance of the Earth and star. 
This was not a consequence of an incorrect parameter, but rather of the 
particular window shape used to display the objects. I usually edit IWP in 
full-screen, so I didn't realize this was happening. Interestingly, I discovered 
upon viewing the standard size that some of the text was running over objects. I 
gave the text 'more room' so this shouldn't happen anymore. The reason I bring 
this up, however, is that it represents a significant inconsistency in the way 
IWP is written:<BR><BR>All objects other than text are displayed according to 
what I shall term a 'contrived size', meaning a size such as 5 meters or 90 
nanometers or some other parameter which IWP converts to pixel sizes by scaling. 
But text objects are displayed according to an 'absolute size' - the font size 
is an actual input number of pixels, and will be that absolute size no matter 
what. So, if you enlarge the window, objects other than text are scaled up 
accordingly, but text remains the same size.<BR><BR>This means that the way IWP 
displays its objects, if some are text and others are not, changes based on what 
resolution of screen and size or shape of window a person is using.<BR><BR>If 
you get a chance to talk to Taylor about this, I imagine it would only take two 
or three lines of code to change the font size input parameter to scale with the 
rest of the objects.<BR><BR>Jason Cockrell<BR><BR>

    including Earth, Mars, and car need to adjust to the reference frame. This 
    should create interesting squashed or elongated shapes. Does that make 
    sense?<BR><BR>2. Can you put the distance scale in terms of light years? In 
    the standard problem of this type, a spaceship travels to Alpha Centauri 4 
    light years away. If the speed is 0.8c, then the time taken from the point 
    of view of an Earth observer is 5 y.<BR><BR>I'd say go ahead with the clocks 
    and labels. The time unit would be years. Digital clocks are
