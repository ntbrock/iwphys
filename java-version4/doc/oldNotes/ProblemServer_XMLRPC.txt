09.09.03 IN wilmington: I have added the problemServer client GUI stuff to
         the designer. It hangs on a refresh. Plus, there is lots of UI
		 flow tweaking to do.







ProblemServer XMLRPC


XML-RPC return strucutre: 
hash { return_code => 1, error_message => '' }

authenticate ( username, password )

listDirectories ( authKey, directory )

listFiles ( authKey, directory )

putFile ( authKey, directory, mime-data? )

getFile ( authKey, directory )

** removeFile ( authKey, file );  //only allowed to remove files in user dir
** renameFile ( authKey, oldFile, newFile );
   //only allowed to remove files in user dir


//----- methods needed for advanced / Adminable access --------

** createDirectory ( authKey, directory ) // not needed

I have put in place the client / server framework for the IWP applet / problem
server communication channel. AppletXMLRPCClient/Servlet are the files. 
I've got a rude command line client + am filling out a lcient library. It
would be good to create a widget client + a test case / harness.

* problem 1: the authkeys keep timing out. It looks like we need a method
in the userDB called 'refresh authkey' that takes an autheky + gives out
a new one. why is this not a problem on the web? (maybe it is...)

Things are looking good now. All I have left to do is bind the XML-RPC
server-side interface to the actual data calls for storing / loading files.
I might have to just do that tonite, so i can show a console version of
the xml-rpc client @ lunch tommorrow.

The authkey problem is fixed. Audited the library. good progress.

I have gotten the upload functionality completed. 
I have a demonstration ready for Dr. Winters tommorrow:

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 DEMO
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 - Start problemserver on laptop
 - log in
 - upload a file
 - animate the file
 - design the file
 - browse the file from the directory
 - remove the file
 - fake-design a file from the admin screen

 - upload another file. (upload2.iwp)
 - move the file to another directory (mkdir DVAT)
 - animate the file

 - Connect with console xmlrpc client
    ./bin/ConsoleXmlRpcClient.sh http://localhost:8000/RPC2 brockman avatar14
   - show login ability (bad username, pass)
   - run listFiles command



00:54 07/24/03 The getFile + setFile client / server communication framework
      is now in place. The setFile seeems to only work once per connection.
	  weird.
