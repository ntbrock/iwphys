Need to replace minml w/ some jaxb generated code. That would be hot.

Replace BBrain w/ a singleton.

GAccessor_designer should be abstract. Apply the abstract concept to
the other designers?

What about change it over to an dinterface implementation?


* Clean out system.err's.


* Run in debug mode and watch what goes on.


Does jaxb allow you to render xml back out?

I think XmlNode is my xml parser. Need to rip him out too.


21:24 awesome. I'm down to just xml deprecation warnings.

21:47 Wow, this is going to take a long time to do. 



Fix this:
DObject_Description.java:

	/* DEPRECATED */
	public DObject_designer getObject_designer ( ) { 
		System.err.println ( "[DObject_Description] getObject_designer call is DEPRECATED!");
		return new DObject_Description_designer ( this );
	}

	public DObject_designer getDesigner ( ) {
		return new DObject_Description_designer ( this );
	}



* Remove constants.

21:53 going through the codebase and ripping out all the System.err's.


21:57 still a lot of systm.err here.
[brockman@sin sandbox]$ egrep -rni System.err * |grep -v \~ |wc -l
538

* Clean up the bin dir.

22:33 almost have all system.err's out. what about system.out?

22:39 all of the errors + warnings are out.

* look at System.out's.

$ egrep -rni System.out * |grep -v \~ |wc -l
221
