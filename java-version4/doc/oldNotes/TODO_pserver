= Clean up the DataStore library: especially the autentication calls. 
  need to throw exceptions instead of nulls.

= Flushed out the user authentication process: now and authkey-style system.

- Add more JSP's / servlets
  = added very basic command / conditional support to the microservlet jsp 
    engine: includes, and if's.
  = added directory browsing
  + user file management page
    - user upload Page
    - user 'designer' page
    + file eiditng page
      - delete
      - rename
      - design ( update )

  - Problem description / viewing page
    = Display the Animator applet
    - Display the designer applet (?)
  - XML Directory browsing + authentication. XMLRPC?
    = XML problem service

    
= spawn a background thread that will sync the various databases down to 
  disc every so often. 
  = not needed: the databases are now syncronously writing themselves to
	disk. the only in-memory data is the authkey bank
    = NOTE: There may be speed issues browsing the directory b/c all files
      have to be parsed to get out user information. A meta index would
      help this greatly if it ever becomes too slow.

= convert the database storage format into XML

= get the userinfo.username jsp call working

= add the problem browsing servlet - both for HTML + applet communication
  = add the get toplevelDirectories to problemDB
    = need to do some database work now. the users need to save. need to
      load problems from disk, etc.
      = the DUserXML(Handler|Parser|Creator) classes are written
        = Fill out the content of : DSingleFileUserDB.java
        = Test it
      = the DProblemXML classes are written
  = need an 'iterate' directive in microservlet.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
microservlet needs:

- pull in the com.oreilly.servlet library for handing multipart data?
