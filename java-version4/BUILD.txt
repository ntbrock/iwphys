There are two distribution packages that can be built:

	iwp.jar  (ant target 'jar')

	iwpStudent.jar    (ant target 'jarStudent')


Both of these jars are signed by our own keystore. They are basically
the same thing except they have different manifest files.

The iwp.jar is the proper file to drop into the webserver to run 
the applets.
