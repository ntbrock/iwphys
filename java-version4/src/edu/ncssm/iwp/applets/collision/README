Collision applet - IWP Codebase

January 16, 2003

This is a project to test the efficiency and hew a design for a library-style
IWP usage. The old codebase was getting too clunky w/ a heavy GUI that nobody
really knew how to design + maintain. We decided (like good programmers) to
reuse our code in a more efficient manner: strip out the 'good stuff' and 
make it available for re-use in a library for other physics software and
applets.

The goal is to steer the development pace of any future Physics software
that our group may produce towards a modular, student-oriented speed. We
need short, concise projects that are educational, modular, and worthwhile
for all parties involved.

This code experiement is a test-run of this concept. I am going to dust off
my textbooks and write a 2 Dimensional collision applet from scratch, re-using
as much of IWP as I can. Brian Sweeney, my partner in crime, is going to 
produce a different applet: a 2 Dimensional multi-function plotter, but take
his own, independent approach. Both of us will explore this concept then
reunite our efforts to negotiate a clean, elegant design of the soon-to-be
iwp library code.
