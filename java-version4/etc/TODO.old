06/24/01 - Strugging w/ init/reset functions. COULD have a think(0) iteration
           to do time == 0 priming of all objects. still undecided.

           ok.. i've passed some changes through. now, the toplevel stuff
           (objects / animators) now get initial problem states when 
           resetting / initting.

           // BUG: The Input widgets aren't displaying. FIXED
           BUG: The Reset button now DOES draw the new input fields,
                and the input fields need some gui-spacing working (beautify)
           BUG: The GWindow_Animator_Inputs needs a reset button to  
                set the values that the users have entered.... the 
                Input_Animators then need to take their' object's names,
                so they can set vars (object.value) properly.

           TODO: ProblemManager Menubar interfaces.



06/23/01 - XML stuff mostly wrapped up.
           BUG: in the calculators for the Shape width/height. Set to zero's.
	            this seems to be in the XML Loading. 
                HA! Found it. was using 'equation' instaed of 'calculator' in 
                SAX.


06/22/01 - in the middle of SAX decoders (readers). made it all the way
		   to the DObject_Solid. still need to finish GShape (calc's),
           and fillin the two path calculators for the Solid object.
           Then, do the 'author' tag.... and do Writes!

           After that, we should be able to load DProblems out of 
           .xml files.... and I can finish the work on the designer.

           A tricky part of the designer / animator will be to put
           all the DProblemManager conduits in place via file menus.

04/30/01: was working on the Problem designer. need to fully flesh that out.
          (transpose gui from GAccessor_Designer to DObject_designer). The 
          next steps after that will be to:
          1. Rip out all problem-specific info form the Brain,, and have
             it only deal w/ 'DProblem's
          2. Make sure all the cascading designer 'gets' work + gui's are 
             operational...  DProblem <-> DObject <-> ( MCalculator, GShape, etc )
          The next steps after that will be obvious.. but the system will be
          mostly reconstructed at that point... going to have the make the
          animator read DProblem objects.

          could work on:
            XML serialization
            Turning the HTTP server into servlets?

04/30/01: ICONS DON'T WORK ANYMORE!

 OLD TODO
------------------------------------------------------------------------------


[7/24/00] ProblemServer: More user adminstration functionality - delete user
[7/24/00] ProblemServer: Student / Assignment interface / database?  (low prior)
[7/24/00] ProblemServer: HTTP image loading + file transfers from the /data/html directory.

[7/24/00] Brain: Replace all of the Remote access stuff w/ DProblem + DProbemClient + ! TEST !. Get it to load problems from the server,, and save them back.

[7/24/00] GraphicsEngine: Outsource the graphic rendering stuff out to the Objects.
[7/24/00] GraphicsEngine: put the mouse feedback layer over the graphics panel + make a new input type.

[7/24/00] Objects: Move all object-specific listing / control to the 'DObjectRegistry'

[7/24/00] GE: Enhance the space object to create inclined planes, or potentially user definable shapes / graphics
[7/24/00] GE: Draw lines.
[7/24/00] GE: Include some stock pictures? (low)

[7/24/00] Be able to graph variables over time.
[7/24/00] Pendulum problems -- inclusion of angular inputs + processing. BIG CHANGE... have to think about this one and get a good plan in order. Polar coordinate conversion system.

[7/24/00] Waves Object
[7/24/00] Doppler Object
[7/24/00] E/M (Generic? woo hoo!) field objects
[7/24/00] Point charge object? .. or charge attribute on a solid? mmmmm ,, or a charged solid?

[7/24/00] Optical bench problems. Big changes.
