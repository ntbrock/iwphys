Perl Problem Server
Interactive Web Physics

brockman 03.19.04


Requirements:

- use xmlrpc_cgi.inc for xml-rpc
- clone the xml-rpc call signature from the existing problemserver Java
  Swing
- create a stand-alone test driver program to flex every command in the
  rpc interface

- create a stub server that does nothing except respond,
  then fill it in with code that acutally scans files, etc.

- use xml-rpc exceptions to transmit errors from the server to the
  client



- needs to use Tribble::Session for both XML-RPC sessions and web 
  browsing sessions

- needs to support file uploads

- + user database

- file management?

- How do I support ACL's easily? Is there a perl module that will do it for 
  me?



23:37 current thinking: write the server copmletely first?
     it's simple enough to test w/ a test driver.

- what about using regular httpd authorization to authorize users?

- we could use Tie::Persistent to store user data to disk

- going to need a file-loader for problem content 
  probably even a rudimentary parser to get information from them.


It should live in /usr/local/iwp/perlProblemServer/
  ./users/
  ./problems/
  ./etc/
  ./templates/


- The web interface should be sure to use PATH_INFO to browse the file
  directory

00:29 getting apache running on my box again + putting the web script to work


01:18 I have a stub xmlrpc server running now. I';m going to jump over to 
      java land to create a swing gui into it.


- should the website access thru xmlrpc? or just access thru the
  native interfaces? native = faster.


- in the java widget, if the user tries to hit load or save and the
  client is not connected, or in an error state, show them only the
  'setup' screen, and grey out the other tab panes. disallow access to
  those when client is not connected.
  - The options are greyed out when you hit disconnect, they're just
    still available when you connect initially and there are problems.
  

- if the swingXmlRpcClient is not initialized correctly, it seems to 
  throw or show nulls.

- Put an applet-size dropdown into the user-facing website.

- compare my problemserver against Brian's php one


02:14 the xml-rpc client seems to be talking well to my server already 
      w/o much modification at all.


-(Future) Nice dialogues would be cool to help show when files can't
  be loaded, etc.

- The file browsing could return more information about each file
  than just the filename.


02:18 ready to actually implement the logic behind a real server.

02:52 the authentication + user database works.

03:09 I have integrated Apache::Session in with the UserSession.pm


- need to fill up the default problemserver installation public 
  directory w/ all the files that brian sweeney has in his dir.

- also, need to test the problemServer w/ application designer on desktop

- windows test

- 'create directory' functionality in PServer client + web client.

- clean up the visual gui components on the problemserver file selection
  dialogue.

04:22 Sweet. Just got the TEST harness to load a problem correctly from
      the perl problemserver.

- on new connetions to host in the gui, it would be good to refresh
  the directories

F add a 'home' button in teh file browser

- Clicking [..] in directory takes you to the top-level of the file system.

- Add a 'my problems' style 'my documents' thing into the file selector.


04:40 calling it a night.

    I just opened up webInteface.cgi. I'm going to bed to draw out the 
 page flow, and I'm going to wake up kinda early to implement it.

 Problems load using the designerApplet.

starting on the web interface real fast.

11:37: got user login to work + sessions. TODO: problem loading + saving.

11:56: the applet needs to be signed before I can use the xml-rpc client
 libraries from w/in it. It's going a property read.

- there seems to be some screweyness with the user auth stuff in IE



15:23 meeting.

= Got the putFile->pps working

- Me replace brian's iwp2 website
- web file upload

- certifty/sign applet

low prior - trim the applet size

brian/paul- cosmetic issues
