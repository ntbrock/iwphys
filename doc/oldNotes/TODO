legend: - TODO  = DONE



Phase 1: Convert the build structure to ANT
03/06/02
	= create build.xml file
	= clean up all build problems

	= create build.sh file
	= build successfully under linux

	= create build.bat file
	= build successfully under win32
	- run successfully under win32
		note: there is a NoClassDefFoundError (wrong name: edu/ncssm/iwp/bin/IWP) everything seems to be in order, though


Phase 2: Convert tree to modern object / directory naming structure
	= Move src/iwp/* to src/edu/ncssm/iwp
	= Eliminate all Upper-case 1st letters of directory names




- need to create a file-saving thread.
