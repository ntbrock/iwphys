HOWTO Use DigiCert to create a key and sign IWP .jar files for browser applet display.

0. Determine the Subject
Note that DigiCert will review the information against an ID.
I ended up changing the certifiate to my personal name, scanning my SC license and passport,
and sending in a notarized form.

Subject:
$ openssl x509 -in nathaniel_brockman.pem -subject

/C=US/ST=South Carolina/L=Mt. Pleasant/O=Nathaniel Brockman/CN=Nathaniel Brockman


1. Create a CSR + Private Key

#http://www.sslshopper.com/article-most-common-openssl-commands.html
openssl req -out CSR.csr -new -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout privateKey.key


2. Upload CSR to DigiCert as new or re-key.


3. Download the intermediate + root as .pem files, best to copy + paste from my account textbox.
   DigiCert_Intermediate.pem
   DigiCert_Root.pem

4. Downlaod the key as a .pem file, best to copy paste to .pem file.
   nathaniel_brockman.pem

5. Build the key + certificate into a Java Key Store (jks)
6. Import the other intermediate + root.

   used Keyman to do these last two steps. Note that keytool doesn't have key import capabilities
