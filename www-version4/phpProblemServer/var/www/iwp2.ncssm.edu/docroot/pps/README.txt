2008-Jan-25 Brockman NCSSM IWP

This collection of PHP files is a simple replacement for the perl problem
server.

There is no xml-rpc interface to the filesystem any more. There are no user
accounts any more.

All of the control is now moved to the webserver and the ftp server that
sit over top of this directory on the new NCSSM webserver.

The original iwp2 machine has gone away and this service is now hosted in a
new spot.
