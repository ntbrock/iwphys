<u>Animator</u>: The half of the IWP software program that will playback saved .iwp files
from the ProblemServer, the web, or the local Hard Drive.<br><br>
<u>Designer</u>: The half of the IWP software program that allows teachers to design problems and create and edit .iwp files.<br><br>
<u>ProblemServer</u>: A web interface and a web service that is a centrally located repository for storing, loading, editing and sharing .iwp animations.<br><br>

<b>1. Download the latest JRE w/ the Java Plug-in</b><br>
<br>

<a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/download.html">http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/download.html</a><br>
Recommended: J2SE v1.4.2_05 JRE<br><Br>

The applet has been tested to run under both Windows and RedHat Linux. 
<br>

<br>
<u>A warning about security:</u><br>
To enable the network problemServer communication, we had to use a 3rd Party XML-RPC 
library that needs access to some protected environment variables. This means that the
applet is signed by us, an untrusted signer. The first time that you load the applet,
you will see the following screen:

<center>
<img src="/pps/gfx/walkthrough/appletSecurity.png" border="1"><br>
<b>Figure: Example Applet Security Warning</b><br>
</center>
<br>

You will need to click "YES" on this screen to grant the applet the correct access rights
to be able to use the problemServer communication.

<b>2. Use the Animator: Browse User Problems (Students)</b><br>
<br>

Load the <a href="/pps/webInterface.cgi/Example%20Problems/">Example User Problems directory</a>. Here you will see sample files that you can animate.<br>

<center>
<img src="/pps/gfx/walkthrough/browseProblems.png" border="1"><br>
<b>Figure: Browsing Example Problems</b><br>
</center><br>

Clicking on the filename (Example Target Problem.iwp) of a file will bring up an Animator Applet webpage. There is a 
java applet tag in this page that should cause the Animator applet to appear as a 
new desktop window and load the desired problem from the problemServer.<br>
<br>

</center><br>

At this point, you can interact with the Animator to play the problem back and 
forth, edit input values, and interact with the physics problem.<br>

<i>TODO: Explain more about the animator controls.</i><br>

<br><br>
<u>Webmaster Tip</u>: You can deep-link to the animator page from other websites to 
integrate IWP content within your own website. To link to the example problem above
create an A HREF link to: <a href="http://iwp2.ncssm.edu/pps/webInterface.cgi/Example%20Problems/Example%20Target%20Problem.iwp">http://iwp2.ncssm.edu/pps/webInterface.cgi/Example%20Problems/Example%20Target%20Problem.iwp</a> (use %20 for spaces). This will work for files out of any public iwp problemServer directory, even your own user directory.

<b>3. Create a User Account and begin designing problems (Teachers)</b><br>
<br>

<u>3.1. Create a user account</u> on the <a href="http://iwp2.ncssm.edu/pps/webInterface.cgi?action=newUser">New User Registration</a> page. Your login is the same as your
email address to make remembering login information easy.<br>
<br>

<b>Figure: New User Registration Screen</b><br>
</center><br>

<br>
<u>3.2. View My Problems</u> once you are logged in. From this screen, you can 
create new problems, edit existing problems, rename files, and delete problems.<br>
<Br>

<center>
<img src="/pps/gfx/walkthrough/myProblems.png" border="1"><br>
<b>Figure: My Problems File List</b><br>
</center><br>

Clicking on the problem name will show a page that will launch the Designer applet
with the problem preloaded. The rest of the buttons on this page should be
self-explanatory. <br>
<br>

</center><br>

<br>
<u>3.3. Using the Designer to communicate with the ProblemServer</u><br>
Once you are editing a file with the designer (either a new problem or an existing
problem), you can save your files to the problemServer or load existing files
from the problemServer.<br>
<br>

To save a file to the problemServer, in the Designer click 'File' (in the menubar),
'Save As', 'ProblemServer'. A dialogue window will pop up that allows you to 
browse the remote server filesystem, delete files, and save your file to the server
with any filename you want. Some names with spaces and underscores and other 
special characters are disallowed.<br>
You should save your problems to the problemServer in your /Users/username@hostname.com/ user directory. This is a directory that you have write access to and is designed for
you to keep your personal files in. <br>

</center><br>

To load a file from the problemServer, in the Designer click 'File', 'Open',
'ProblemServer'. This will spawn the open file dialogue, where you can browse around
until you find a file that you like, and then open it.<br>

<br>

</center><br>


The setup screen should already have your connection information entered into it.
If you are ever disconnected, the username + password are the same email address + 
password that you use on the problemServer website to login.<br>

</center><br>

<br>
<u>3.4 Local Files</u> are usable because the applet is signed. You can use the 
'Local File' option under the 'Open', 'Save', and 'Save As' to work locally on 
.iwp files.<br>

<br>

<u>Tip:</u> To make a copy of a file, Load it from the problemServer with the designer
and then 'Save As' to save it under a new filename in your /Users/ directory.<br>
<br>

<u>Tip:</u> Every IWP Problem file must have a .iwp extension on it to be properly
recognized by the client and the server<br><br>
