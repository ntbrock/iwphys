 
Sagar has successfully demonstrated three new functions:
 
1. traveling waves and their superposition
2. doppler effect
3. interference of point sources
 
He's also working on reflection and refraction.
 
Regarding 1-3, Sagar is ready to incorporate his work into version 3.  He anticipates that process with debugging will take a week.  Sounds like we should have a meeting later this month to see where we are, etc.  Your schedule indicated that version 3 would be launched Feb - March.  Is that still feasible?
 
Would you be able to meet on a Saturday this month?
