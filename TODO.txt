I am enabling the ordered object calculation

= Symbol extractor in Mequation works
= Convert the Euler_Calculator_designer to use the new MEquation parser.
= Write a test for the symbol extractor
= In the GWindow_Animator, actually rejumble the objects
= Make all calculations look at the current tick. Dont' travel back one. Time test works.
= Try out all the packaged problems - some hav emissing variables.

= Make the canvas bigger by default


= Make DObjcet an interface in plugin: IWPObject
= Make a DObjectFactory and a DObject list designableObjects - and have this read from
   the plugin list.
  
= Create an IPWObjectFactory visual testing harness.

= Clean up the time input widget on the Animator.

= Ending time doesn't appear to be honored now. 

= create a new object; Floating STring, plus document descriing hwo to create a new object.

= The animation ordering now needs to be independent of the calculation ordering. I may geto
bject overlapping problems now.

--------------------

* File -> Save should re-use load format and not have a sub-menu.
* File -> Save should should pre-display the current filename in the dialog.

* Create a new object: Plot Overlay, Function overlay.
