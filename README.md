Interactive Web Physics - Version 5 and Beyond!


## Version 5 Feature Roadmap

- Modern, Clean User Interface (WebLookAndFeel?)

- Embeddable Applets within Pages, no popups.

- Browser Problem List on the Web, www.iwphys.org

- Generation of Thumbnails / Directories for Web Browsing
  	     (Gif Animations?)

- Web Rating system for problems, comments?

- GPL/MIT License Review

- Shrink applet Jar size as much as possible

- Can we render in D3 instead of Java Applet? :)
  This would run on Tablets, but really necessary for educational situation?
